# ESC-POS-.NET
.NET (C#) Implementation of the Epson ESC/POS standard.   MIT licensed.

# Supported Platforms
Supports Windows, Linux, and Mac OSX!  
Epson thermal receipt printers are supported, and most common functions such as test printing, styling, alignment, image printing, and barcode printing.
BemaTech printers are also tested by some members of the community, @juliogamasso and @ivanmontilla.


## Getting Started
Check out the ESCPOS_NET.ConsoleTest for a comprehensive test suite that covers all implemented functions.


This package is available on NuGet @ https://www.nuget.org/packages/ESCPOS_NET/

Please comment / DM / open issues and let me know how the library is working for you!
